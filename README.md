# AutosRUs

## Overview
In this project we take a focus on statistics, and the programming language R. Statistics is a cornerstone of data analytics, and helps us to contextual our data. Statistics take a critical role when it comes to making important decisions, and this is the case in any field. In the professional world, those who are familiar with statistics tend to be the go to people within a company when it comes to the decision making, troubleshooting, and resource planning. In this project we will review statistics and regression models, as well as explore more advanced statistical models commonly used in data analytics. Lastly, we will design and interpret statistical studies. The perfect tool to use for data analysis other than Python, is the R language, a language made by data analysts for data analysts. R was developed for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The basics of R include reading a dataset, manipulating the data, performing calculation, and creating data visualizations with two dimensional plots. With all of its benefits, the biggest drawback of R is its licensing. R, as well as most of its libraries, are licensed as General Public license, as in any program or model using R will be forcibly be open source. Often time this will not be an issue because a data analyst plans on publishing their findings anyway. However, when working with a company with intellectual property, or propriety data and programs this can be an issue. In these cases, a company may use R for internal analysis, and use Python for any application or script that contains propriety information. Nonetheless, R is still a highly valuable programming language for data analysis, and is used by data professionals at all levels across all fields. We will be using the IDE RStudio to help us design and test R scripts. Similarly to Jupyter Notebook, RStudio enables programmers to test their code line by line to allow users to troubleshoot any problems efficiently and easily.

In this project I will be working with a mock company, AutosRUs, who have realized that their decision making process should be moved into the 21st century. I will be tasked with performing retrospective analysis of the companies historic data, analytical verification, validation of current automotive specifications, and study design of future project testing. The company recognizes that the most successful automobile models utilize data analytics in every decision making process. To make our project as fruitful as possible, we’ll have to ensure that our analysis contains a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric, and clear interpretation of the results. We will perform our statistical tests using the R programming language. We will have to provide summary statistics for different variables, visualizations for different data sets, and a personal interpretation of the statistical test results. We will also have to use our critical thinking skills to create a study design, hypothesis, and analysis workflow.

The R language has a large community, and great number of supportive documentation. Check out this site for more information on the methods used in this project https://www.rdocumentation.org/. For documentation on the tidyverse library check out this source, https://www.tidyverse.org/. 

## Process
•	Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.

In addition to the native statistical functions, there are many other useful data transformation and modelling libraries, such as the tidyverse package, that simplify the process of ETL and visualizations.
To install the tidyverse package, enter the following code into RStudios Console: ```install.packages("tidyverse")```.

•	Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.

•	Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.

•	Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.

•	Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.

•	Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.

•	Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.

•	Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.

•	Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.
